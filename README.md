        <p>In my coding journey, I am coming across ALOT of interesting code snippets that might become useful in the future. 
If possible and needed, I will be adding attribution to whom wrote it and where I found it.

If you want to add some snippets that you have found yourself to this for easy access, please add them to the appropriate folder, and state where you got them from and who wrote them as a reference to others.

Please remember that I am a newbie to this coding stuff, so this may not be the prettiest thing in the world.
