   <h1 align="center">â˜  The reasoning for this  repository â˜ </h1>
        <p>I know that there are a lot of tutorial sites and informational sites etc. out there with this information, and if you are like me then you have about a million pages bookmarked and finding the simplest things might not be so easy. So as I I am learning, I will be adding simple notes and examples here to help me, but also to help anyone else that may find them useful. Feel free to add to this, make a copy to your own Github, or even leave a comment. I am still learning Github, so be kind.</p>
          
<p><i>Please remember that I am a newbie to this coding stuff, so this may not be the prettiest thing in the world.</i></p>
