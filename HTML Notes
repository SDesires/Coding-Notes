☠ HTML NOTES ☠

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
HTML files are text files, so you can use any text editor to write them on.

The head of an HTML file contains all of the non-visual elements that help make the page work.
<html>
<head></head>
</html>

The body tag follows the head tag and defines the main content of the HTML document.
All visual-structural elements are contained within the body tag.
<html>
<head></html>
<body></body>
</html>

The title tag places a title on the tab describing the web page and is added within the head. 
The title element is important because it describes the page and is used by search engines.
<html>
<head>
<title>My Funky Page</title>
</head>
<body></body>
</html>

To add a paragraph, you use the p tag. 
<html>
<head>
<title>My Funky Page</title>
</head>
<body>
<p> This is a paragraph. Impressed yet? lol</p>
</body>
</html>

The br tag is a line break tag. If you need a line of space between text or other things on your page, that's the tag you would use. 
It is said that since it's an empty element that you don't need a closing tag to it, but I am old school 
(I used to use HTML before it got all fancy with a 5 at the end of it lol)and close all my tags out of habit. 
<html>
<head>
<title>My Funky Page</title>
</head>
<body>
<p> This is a paragraph. <br>Impressed yet? lol</br></p><!--This is my way and probably outdated-->
<p> This is another paragraph. <br />Are we able to take over the world yet?</p><!--this is the recommended way-->
</body>
</html>

Before CSS was all the rage and took over every part of styling HTML code, there were specific HTML tags for certain text formatting. 
They also added a few new ones it looks like.
<html>
<head>
<title>My Funky Page</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is normal text with no bells or whistles.<p>
<p><b>This is bold text, for when you want people to know that something is important or something.</b></p>
<p><big>This is big text, because, well...to write big stuff.</big></p>
<p><i>This is italic text to make things all fancy shmancy.</i></p>
<p><small>This is small text to make people squint at their screen for no other reason other then the fact that we can.</small></p>
<p><strong>This is strong text aka the new and improved bold text , but with a longer tag.</strong></p><!--the strong tag is a phrase tag. It defines important text.-->
<p><sub>This is subscripted text.</sub></p>
<p><sup>This is superscripted text.</sup></p>
<p><ins>This is subscripted text.</ins></p>
<p><del>This is deleted text.</del></p><!--this is a new one on me-->
</html>
<!--USEFUL NOTE: Browsers display <strong> as <b>, and <em> as <i>.
However, the meanings of these tags differ: <b> and <i> define bold and italic text, respectively, while <strong> and <em> indicate that the text is "important".-->

There are six levels of headings, which are ranked according to importance.
These are <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, and <h6>. 
It's in bad taste to use a heading tag to simply make your text bold, since search engines use headings to determine the content of a page and such.

To create a horizontal line, use the <hr /> tag. Apparently they call this a "thematic break" now. They used to be called a divider. 

<!--This is a comment in HTML, in case you haven't guessed by now lol-->

Each tag is called an element. Make sure to write your code neatly so you don't lose track of which ones are open or closed.

Now here's where it gets tricky...Attributes provide additional information about an element or a tag, while also modifying them. 
Most attributes have a value, and the value modifies the attribute. 
Most people know that you use CSS nowadays to modify HTML, however, attributes are still useful in HTML when you aren't familiar with CSS yet, 
or if you just want to keep it simple.

In HTML you can use pixels (px) or percentages (50%) for size attributes, such as width or height. 
Please note that the align attribute has been replaced by CSS styles and is supposedly not supported by HTML5. 
I used it in the README file of this repository and it worked fine on my browser (Opera) so perhaps it's not quite obsolete yet. 
You should learn to use the CSS version anyhow, since HTML and CSS go hand in hand these days. So, for a quick example:

p {
  align: left;
  align: center;
  align: right;
  align: justify; 
  
  }

I'll probably explain this more in the CSS Notes when I get there. I'm sure that I'm missing other options here.
